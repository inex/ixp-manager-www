<h2>Call for Sponsorship</h2>

<p>
    IXP Manager began as an internal project at INEX and we chose to open source it in 2012.
    To date, INEX has borne nearly the complete development, maintenance, support and project
    management burden of the project. However, in writing down the plans we would like to
    achieve – coupled with our current workload and available resources – we have come to
    the realisation that to fully develop IXP Manager into all we hope it can be, we needed
    to look at a more sustainable funding model and hire a full time developer.
</p>

    Our call for funding document (including year one development plan and year two and three outlook)
    can be <a href="media/2016/2016-02-Funding-Model-1.4.pdf">downloaded here</a>.
