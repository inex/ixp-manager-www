<h2>Call for Sponsorship</h2>

<p>
    IXP Manager began as an internal project at INEX and we chose to open source it in 2012.
    INEX has borne nearly the complete development, maintenance, support and project
    management burden of the project until we started the sponsorship program in late 2016.
</p>
<p>
    To continue to develop IXP Manager into all we hope it can be, we needed
    to look at a more sustainable funding model and hire a full time developer.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    we have published a number of documents relating to the sponsorship program:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Our original call for funding document (including year one development plan and
    year two and three outlook) can be
    <a href="/media/2016/2016-02-Funding-Model-1.4.pdf">downloaded here</a>.
    </li>
    <li> A public version of our 2017 year end report to the sponsors' can be
